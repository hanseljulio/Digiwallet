# React Assignment - DigiWallet

This is a React project which simulates a digital bank.

Users can register, log in and do banking things like checking their transaction history, transfer money to another account, add money to their account, and play a game to earn prizes in the form of cash that will be added to their account.

Users who did not log in will be unable to access the features of the bank and instead will be redirected to an error page.

## Available Scripts

To set up the project, you need to use both the frontend and backend:

### Backend

Start from the root folder.

1. If you are using Ubuntu: go to `cd backend/build/linux_intel` and run on the terminal `./http_server_linux_intel_v2`
2. If you are using Mac: go to `cd backend/build/mac_m1` and run on the terminal `./http_server_mac_m1_v2`

Now open another terminal for the frontend.

### Frontend

Back in the root folder, go to `cd frontend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Now run `npm start`

The project should now have both its frontend and backend running.
